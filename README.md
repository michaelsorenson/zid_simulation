# Description
This repo contains a notebook to simulate a cell's ribosomes and RNA using a [simulation](https://github.com/shahpr/SMoPT) created by the [Shah lab](https://www.theshahlab.org/). The purpose of these simulations is to understand what harringtonine and cycloheximide rates correspond to what initiation & elongation rates. By understanding this relationship, we can then specify an exact initiation rate and elongation rate, and then see what those rates look like in terms of RNA ribosomal distribution. Then, we can compare these results to the Zid lab's results for cells under different types of stress (especially glucose starvation)

# Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/michaelsorenson/zid_simulation.git
cd zid_simulation
git clone https://github.com/shahpr/SMoPT.git
```

Run notebook to see simulation results.
